This study evaluates the thermal performance of a 50-fin aluminum heat sink for a 100 W CPU across inlet air velocities from 0 to 13 m/s using three-dimensional conjugate heat transfer analysis in STAR-CCM+. The parametric investigation identifies optimal fan speed trade-offs between thermal performance, power consumption, and acoustic constraints for consumer electronics applications.
