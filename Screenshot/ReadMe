The nameing of the Screenshot follows the following system:

0v, 1v, 3v, … = inlet air velocity (0, 1, 3 m/s, etc.).

Suffix -T = temperature contour only.

Suffix -v = velocity magnitude + streamlines only.

Suffix -Tv = temperature field shown together with the velocity field (streamlines overlaid).
